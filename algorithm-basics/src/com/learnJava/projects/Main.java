        //Search Algorithm
    // One of the most common types of algorithms is a search algorithm ...
    // the purpose of a search algorithm is to find things like for example a file
    // within a set of folders, or a word within a document


        //Sorting Algorithm
   // An algorithm that can order things ... like numbers from smallest to largest or
   // letters in alphabetical order.


        //Computational Algorithms
   // Takes one set of data and creates another set of data from it ... for example:
   // Boolean - Yes or no?  -- Is this number even?
   // or ...
   // Taking the value of degrees in fahrenheit and converting it to celsius


        //Collection Algorithms
    //Works with a collection of data and can count the amount of items, or can remove
    // unwanted items -- (like empty cells of a csv)
